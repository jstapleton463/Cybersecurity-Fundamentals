# Linux Command Line Basics

### Overview

This laboratory exercise will provide a fundamental understanding of the Linux Terminal (also referred to as the command-line), a powerful tool for all cyber security professionals. The terminal allows a user to manipulate files, create users, and run terminal programs to perform certain tasks. 

This lab will be similar to our lab with Windows Command Prompt. However, you will notice some differences; some things are easier in Linux, but the operating system will be unfamiliar to many of you.

### Getting Set Up:

1.) Follow this link to the [Virginia Cyber Range registration page](https://console.virginiacyberrange.net/register)

2.) Sign in with Google, and use this code to register for the course: `2VH3HXAEHZUE`

3.) Find the *Kali Linux Virtual Machine Environment* in the course exercises.

4.) Click the "play" button to join the virtual machine. If the browser blocks it, click into the omnibox and enable pop-ups.

The Kali Linux virtual machine is a remote computing system (as in, it is somewhere else, not in the classroom with us). We are connecting to it over the internet, and controlling the operating system as if we were in the room with it.

### Accessing the VM

Once you launch the VM, you will need to sign in. The username is `student` and the password is `student` as well (very secure).

It will take a moment to load. Be patient.

Click on the `terminal` icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Then, go to the [lab instruction page](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ttIrtGg8C4BeWsNJHtuNgrIrlVr8prfq5XHJOgFTSYI&authuser=1)
